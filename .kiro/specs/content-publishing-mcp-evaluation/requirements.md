# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess how Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers can address key challenges in the content publishing industry. The system will analyze use cases around content protection, data mining, monetization, access control, and content trustee services to determine MCP server applicability and implementation strategies.

## Glossary

- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server that provides structured access to content and data sources
- **Content Publisher**: Organizations that create, distribute, and monetize digital content
- **Content Scraping**: Unauthorized automated extraction of content from websites or platforms
- **Data Mining**: Process of extracting valuable insights from large datasets of content
- **Content Monetization**: Methods and strategies for generating revenue from digital content
- **Gated Content**: Content that requires authentication, payment, or specific permissions to access
- **AI Agent**: Automated software systems that can interact with and process content
- **Content Trustee**: Entity that manages and validates content authenticity and access rights
- **Evaluation Framework**: Systematic approach for assessing MCP server solutions against industry use cases

## Use Case Ranking and Complexity Analysis

### Priority Ranking (High to Low Impact)
1. **Content Monetization** - Highest revenue potential and business impact
2. **AI Company Brand Awareness** - Critical for long-term market positioning and survival
3. **Gated Content Protection** - Critical for protecting valuable content assets
4. **Content Trustee Services** - Essential for establishing industry trust and standards
5. **Anti-Scraping Protection** - Important for content security but reactive approach
6. **Exclusive Data Mining** - Valuable but requires existing content infrastructure

### Implementation Complexity Levels

| Use Case | Complexity Level | Delivery Timeline | Key Challenges |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Content Monetization | **Medium** | 3-4 months | Payment integration, usage tracking |
| AI Company Brand Awareness | **High** | 4-6 months | Multi-channel integration, brand tracking analytics |
| Gated Content Protection | **High** | 4-6 months | AI agent detection, sophisticated access control |
| Content Trustee Services | **Very High** | 6-8 months | Blockchain/verification systems, industry standards |
| Anti-Scraping Protection | **Low-Medium** | 2-3 months | Rate limiting, basic authentication |
| Exclusive Data Mining | **Medium-High** | 4-5 months | Data processing pipelines, selective exposure |
