      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          userId: { type: "string" },
          contentId: { type: "string" },
          accessLevel: { type: "string", enum: ["free", "premium", "enterprise"] }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      name: "grant_temporary_access",
      description: "Provide time-limited access to premium content",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          userId: { type: "string" },
